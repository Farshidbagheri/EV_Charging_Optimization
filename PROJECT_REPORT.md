# AI-Powered EV Charging Station Management: Project Report

## Executive Summary

This project implements a reinforcement learning-based system for managing electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. The system optimizes charging schedules, reduces waiting times, and balances grid load while considering dynamic electricity prices. Using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, we achieved a 70.33% charging completion rate while maintaining stable grid loads and competitive pricing.

## Project Goals

1. **Optimize Charging Operations**
   - Maximize charging station utilization
   - Minimize customer waiting times
   - Ensure fair and efficient queue management

2. **Balance Grid Load**
   - Prevent grid overload during peak hours
   - Distribute charging load efficiently
   - Maintain stable power consumption

3. **Implement Dynamic Pricing**
   - Adjust prices based on demand and grid load
   - Incentivize off-peak charging
   - Ensure cost-effectiveness for customers

## Methodology

### Environment Design

The charging station environment (`EVChargingEnv`) simulates:
- 10 charging stations with 50 kW capacity each
- Queue management for up to 20 vehicles
- Dynamic vehicle arrival rates based on time of day
- Real-time grid load monitoring
- Time-based electricity pricing

### State Space
Five key features:
1. Queue length (0-20)
2. Available stations (0-10)
3. Current grid load (0-1000 kW)
4. Electricity price (0-1.0)
5. Time of day (0-24)

### Action Space
- Discrete actions (0-10) representing the number of vehicles to start charging
- Actions consider available stations and queue length

### Reward Structure
- +50 for each completed charging session
- +20 for starting new charging sessions
- -5 per vehicle in the queue
- -10 * (load_factor - 1.5) for high grid loads
- -10 * (price - 0.8) for high electricity prices
